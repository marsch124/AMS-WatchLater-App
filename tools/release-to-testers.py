"""Releases the build just uploaded to the tester group, so it actually
reaches the phone.

A successful upload does NOT put a build in TestFlight. It sits in App Store
Connect until it is released to a group, and an internal group does not pick
new builds up by itself — each one has to be assigned. Twice I told him the
group would do it automatically, and twice he had to come back and say the new
version was not there. So the pipeline does it.

Needs, in the environment: ASC_KEY_ID, ASC_ISSUER_ID, ASC_KEY_PATH,
plus APP_BUNDLE_ID and BUILD_VERSION. Standard library and openssl only.
